\description{
The coordinate system used to generate pitch markings in
can be customised by supplying a pitch specification to the \code{dimensions}
argument of \code{annotate_pitch}.

ggsoccer provides pitch specifications for a few popular data providers by default.
However, user-defined specifications can also be used.
}
\details{
A "pitch specification" is simply a list of dimensions that define a
coordinate system. The required dimensions are:

\itemize{
\item{"length"}{The length of the pitch from one goal to the other (x axis)}
\item{"width"}{The width of the pitch from touchline to the other (y axis)}
\item{"penalty_box_length"}{The distance from the goalline to the edge of the penalty area}
\item{"penalty_box_width"}{The width of the penalty area}
\item{"six_yard_box_length"}{The distance from the goalline to the edge of the six-yard box}
\item{"six_yard_box_width"}{The width of the six-yard box}
\item{"penalty_spot_distance"}{The distance from the goalline to the penalty spot}
\item{"goal_width"}{The distance from one goal post to the other}
\item{"origin_x"}{The minimum x coordinate of the pitch}
\item{"origin_y"}{The minimum y coordinate of the pitch}
}

The following pitch dimensions are provided
\itemize{
\item{"pitch_statsperform"}{For StatsPerform/Opts f24 data}
\item{"pitch_opta"}{Alias for "pitch_statsperform"}
\item{"pitch_statsbomb"}{For Statsbomb data}
\item{"pitch_wyscout"}{For Wyscout data}
\item{"pitch_international"}{As per UEFA Category 4 stadium regulations}
\item{"pitch_tracab"}{"For ChyronHego Tracab, using the 105m x 68m default size"}
\item{"pitch_impect"}{For IMPECT data}
}
