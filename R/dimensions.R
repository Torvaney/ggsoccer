#' Pitch dimensions
#'
#' @description The coordinate system used to generate pitch markings in
#' can be customised by supplying a pitch specification to the `dimensions`
#' argument of `annotate_pitch`.
#'
#' ggsoccer provides pitch specifications for a few popular data providers by default.
#' However, user-defined specifications can also be used.
#'
#' @details A "pitch specification" is simply a list of dimensions that define a
#' coordinate system. The required dimensions are:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{"length"}{The length of the pitch from one goal to the other (x axis)}
#'  \item{"width"}{The width of the pitch from touchline to the other (y axis)}
#'  \item{"penalty_box_length"}{The distance from the goalline to the edge of the penalty area}
#'  \item{"penalty_box_width"}{The width of the penalty area}
#'  \item{"six_yard_box_length"}{The distance from the goalline to the edge of the six-yard box}
#'  \item{"six_yard_box_width"}{The width of the six-yard box}
#'  \item{"penalty_spot_distance"}{The distance from the goalline to the penalty spot}
#'  \item{"goal_width"}{The distance from one goal post to the other}
#'  \item{"origin_x"}{The minimum x coordinate of the pitch}
#'  \item{"origin_y"}{The minimum y coordinate of the pitch}
#' }
#'
#' The following pitch dimensions are provided
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{"pitch_opta"}{For Opta f24 data}
#'  \item{"pitch_statsbomb"}{For Statsbomb data}
#'  \item{"pitch_wyscout"}{For Wyscout data}
#'  \item{"pitch_international"}{As per UEFA Category 4 stadium regulations}
#'  \item{"pitch_tracab"}{"For ChyronHego Tracab, using the 105m x 68m default size"}

#' Create Tracab dimensions object from pitch length and width
#'
#' @description When the actual length and width of a pitch are known,
#' for example from Tracab file metadata, `make_pitch_tracab` can be
#' used to replace the 105m x 68m defaults hardcoded in `pitch_tracab`.
#' The remaining pitch markings are taken from the
#' UEFA Category 4 standard (`pitch_international`).
#'
#' @param length Length of the pitch in metres
#' @param width Width of the pitch in metres
