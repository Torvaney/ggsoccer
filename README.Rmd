## Overview

ggsoccer provides a handful of functions that make it easy to plot soccer 
event data in R/ggplot2.

## Installation

ggsoccer is available via CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggsoccer")
```

Alternatively, you can download the development version from github like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("torvaney/ggsoccer")
```

## Usage

```{r example_blank, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsoccer)

ggplot() +
  annotate_pitch() +
  theme_pitch()
```

The following example uses ggsoccer to solve a realistic problem: plotting a set 
of passes onto a soccer pitch.

```{r example_passes}
pass_data <- data.frame(x = c(24, 18, 64, 78, 53),
                        y = c(43, 55, 88, 18, 44),
                        x2 = c(34, 44, 81, 85, 64),
                        y2 = c(40, 62, 89, 44, 28))

ggplot(pass_data) +
  annotate_pitch() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = x2, yend = y2),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"),
                             type = "closed")) +
  theme_pitch() +
  direction_label() +
  ggtitle("Simple passmap", 
          "ggsoccer example")
```

Because ggsoccer is implemented as ggplot layers, it makes customising a plot 
very easy. Here is a different example, plotting shots on a **green** pitch.

Note that by default, ggsoccer will display the whole pitch. To display a 
subsection of the pitch, simply set the plot limits as you would with any other
ggplot2 plot. Here, we use the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments to `coord_flip`.

Note that because of the way coordinates get flipped, we must also reverse the y-axis
to ensure that the orientation remains correct by reversing the order of the limits 
in `coord_flip`. You can do this with either `scale_y_reverse` or by reversing the
order of the limits in `coord_flip`'s `ylim` argument.

If you don't correct (i.e. reverse) the y axis orientation, the penalty box arcs will appear 
inside the box!

```{r example_shots}
shots <- data.frame(x = c(90, 85, 82, 78, 83, 74, 94, 91),
                    y = c(43, 40, 52, 56, 44, 71, 60, 54))

ggplot(shots) +
  annotate_pitch(colour = "white",
                 fill   = "springgreen4",
                 limits = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y),
             colour = "yellow",
             size = 4) +
  theme_pitch() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "springgreen4")) +
  coord_flip(xlim = c(49, 101)) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  ggtitle("Simple shotmap",
          "ggsoccer example")
```

### Data providers

ggsoccer defaults to Opta's 100x100 coordinate system. However, different data 
providers may use alternative coordinates. 

ggsoccer provides support for a few data providers out of the box,
as well as an interface for any custom coordinate system:

* Opta
* Statsbomb
* Wyscout

#### Statsbomb

```{r example_passes_sb}
# ggsoccer enables you to rescale coordinates from one data provider to another, too
to_statsbomb <- rescale_coordinates(from = pitch_opta, to = pitch_statsbomb)

passes_rescaled <- data.frame(x  = to_statsbomb$x(pass_data$x),
                              y  = to_statsbomb$y(pass_data$y),
                              x2 = to_statsbomb$x(pass_data$x2),
                              y2 = to_statsbomb$y(pass_data$y2))

ggplot(passes_rescaled) +
  annotate_pitch(dimensions = pitch_statsbomb) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = x2, yend = y2),
               colour = "coral",
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm"),
                             type = "closed")) +
  theme_pitch() +
  direction_label(x_label = 60) +
  ggtitle("Simple passmap", 
          "Statsbomb co-ordinates")
```

#### Custom data

To plot data for a dataset not provided, ggsoccer just requires
a pitch specification. This is a list containing the required pitch dimensions
like so:

```{r example_custom}
pitch_custom <- list(
  length = 150,
  width = 100,
  penalty_box_length = 25,
  penalty_box_width = 60,
  six_yard_box_length = 8,
  six_yard_box_width = 26,
  penalty_spot_distance = 16,
  goal_width = 12,
  origin_x = 0,
  origin_y = 0
)

ggplot() +
  annotate_pitch(dimensions = pitch_custom) +
  theme_pitch()
```

### Goals

The standard "box" goals may not be perfectly suited to your use-case. ggsoccer
allows you to customise your goals markings by supplying a function to 
the `goals` argument of `annotate_pitch`:

```{r example_goals_line}
ggplot() +
  annotate_pitch(fill = "steelblue4", colour = "white", goals = goals_line) +
  theme_pitch() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "steelblue4"))
```

```{r example_goals_strip}
ggplot() +
  annotate_pitch(goals = goals_strip, fill = "lightgray") +
  theme_pitch()
```

Since this argument just requires a function (or a one-sided formula), 
you can modify the supplied functions, or create your own goal markings function.
Additionally, the `goals` argument supports using one-sided formulas as lambda functions
(see [`rlang::as_function`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/as_function.html)).

Custom goals functions must accept the arguments used by `annotate_pitch`: `colour`, `fill`, 
`dimensions`, `linewidth`, `alpha`, and `linetype`. Additional arguments can also be added.

```{r example_goals_custom}
goals_custom <- function(colour, fill, dimensions, ...) {
  goals_strip(colour, fill, dimensions, lineend = "square", linewidth = 3.5)
}

ggplot() +
  annotate_pitch(
    goals = goals_custom, 
    fill = "lightgray"
  ) +
  theme_pitch()
```

See `help(goals_box)` for the full list of available functions.

The idea for having multiple goal markings was taken and adapted from the [fc.rstats](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/fc.rstats) package.

## Other options

There are other packages that offer alternative pitch plotting options. 
Depending on your use case, you may want to check these out too:

* [soccermatics](https://github.com/JoGall/soccermatics)
* [SBpitch](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/SBpitch)
* [fc.rstats](https://github.com/FCrSTATS/fc.rstats)

### Python

There are a couple of pitch plotting options for matplotlib, too:

* [mplsoccer](https://github.com/andrewRowlinson/mplsoccer)
* [matplotsoccer](https://github.com/TomDecroos/matplotsoccer)
