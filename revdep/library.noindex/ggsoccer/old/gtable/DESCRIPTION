Description: Tools to make it easier to work with "tables" of 'grobs'. The
    'gtable' package defines a 'gtable' grob class that specifies a grid
    along with a list of grobs and their placement in the grid. Further
    the package makes it easy to manipulate and combine 'gtable' objects
    so that complex compositions can be built up sequentially.
