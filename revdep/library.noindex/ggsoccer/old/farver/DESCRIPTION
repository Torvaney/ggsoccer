Description: The encoding of colour can be handled in many different ways,
    using different colour spaces. As different colour spaces have
    different uses, efficient conversion between these representations are
    important. The 'farver' package provides a set of functions that gives
    access to very fast colour space conversion and comparisons
    implemented in C++, and offers speed improvements over the
    'convertColor' function in the 'grDevices' package.
